The project is hosted on Heroku at the following URL: https://intense-beach-07319.herokuapp.com/

It is hosted on a free tier so it may take a moment for the application to wake up.

## Context
This project was created through a React online course with extensive practise of useState with a more complicated exercise of handling the playing of audio. 
I took what I learned here to add a background darkmode, additional Sass effects, and a shuffle song feature to enhance the baseline project (complete with mediocre Garage Band music made by me).
